1. **Grade Disparity**: Adjumani has significantly more D and E grades than Moyo
2. **Excellence Gap**: Moyo has over twice the percentage of top grades (A & B)
3. **Absenteeism Problem**: Adjumani has higher absenteeism in both raw numbers and rates
4. **Competency Crisis**: The high percentage of E grades in Adjumani indicates a basic competency crisis
