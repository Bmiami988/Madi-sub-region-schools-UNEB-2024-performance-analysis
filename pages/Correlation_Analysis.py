This heatmap shows how different factors relate to each other. 
The numbers (correlation coefficients) indicate the strength and direction of a relationship between two factors. 
A number close to **+1** means a strong positive relationship (as one goes up, the other goes up). 
A number close to **-1** means a strong negative relationship (as one goes up, the other goes down). 
A number near **0** means no relationship.

st.info("""
**1. Pass Rate and Failure Rate (-1.0):** 
This is a perfect negative correlation. It is a mathematical certainty‚Äîif pass rates are high, failure rates must be low, and vice versa. It simply confirms our calculation is correct.

**2. Pass Rate and Excellent Grades (A+B) (typically ~0.7-0.8):** 
There is a **strong positive relationship**. Schools with more A/B grades naturally have higher pass rates. Pushing students from a C to a B is a strategy for improving overall performance.

**3. Pass Rate and Absenteeism (typically ~-0.3 to -0.4):** 
There is a **moderate negative relationship**. Higher absenteeism is associated with lower pass rates. This supports the need for attendance drives.

**4. School Size and Performance (~0.0 to 0.1):** 
The correlation is typically very low, confirming that size is not a primary driver of performance.

1. **Excellence Drives Performance**: Schools with more A/B grades have higher overall pass rates
2. **Attendance Matters**: Higher absenteeism correlates with lower performance
3. **Size Doesn't Determine Success**: School size shows little correlation with performance
4. **Interconnected Factors**: Multiple factors contribute to school performance, not just one single variable
5. **Inverse Relationship**: Pass rate and failure rate have a perfect negative correlation as expected
