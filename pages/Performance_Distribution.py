1. **Performance Distribution**: Moyo schools cluster at high performance levels, while Adjumani schools show wide variation
2. **Failure Patterns**: Adjumani has concerning clusters of schools with high failure rates
3. **Size Not Deterministic**: School size doesn't correlate strongly with performance
4. **Excellence Models**: Top-performing schools are predominantly in Moyo and should be studied for best practices
