st.info("""
1. **Performance Gap**: Moyo significantly outperforms Adjumani across all metrics
2. **School Distribution**: Schools are evenly distributed, ruling out quantity as a factor
3. **Student Population**: Adjumani serves more students with similar school count
4. **School Size**: Adjumani schools are larger on average, potentially straining resources
