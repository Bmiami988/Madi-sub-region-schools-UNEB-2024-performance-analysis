1. **Significant Performance Gap**: Moyo district outperforms Adjumani across all metrics
2. **Widespread Challenges in Adjumani**: Majority of schools in Adjumani are in Fair or Poor performance categories
3. **Absenteeism Problem**: Adjumani has higher absenteeism rates, contributing to performance issues
4. **Excellence Gap**: Moyo has over twice the percentage of top grades (A & B) than Adjumani

# Recommendations
st.header("üéØ Recommended Action Plan")

st.success("""
**I. IMMEDIATE INTERVENTIONS (0-6 months):**
- Target support for Adjumani schools in "Poor" performance category
- Implement absenteeism reduction programs with community involvement
- Establish peer learning between top Moyo schools and struggling Adjumani schools

**II. DISTRICT-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES:**
- **For ADJUMANI**: Intensive teacher training, resource allocation to highest-need schools, community engagement
- **For MOYO**: Maintain and share best practices, focus on reducing failure rates in moderate-performing schools

**III. SYSTEMIC IMPROVEMENTS (6-18 months):**
- Regular performance monitoring and data-driven interventions
- Infrastructure improvement in underperforming schools
- Scholarship programs to encourage academic excellence
- Parent-teacher partnerships to support student learning

**IV. LONG-TERM STRATEGIES (18+ months):**
- Curriculum review and alignment with regional needs
- Leadership development programs for school administrators
- Technology integration in teaching and learning
- Public-private partnerships for educational support

# Conclusion
st.header("‚úÖ Conclusion")

st.info("""
The analysis reveals a significant educational performance gap between Moyo and Adjumani districts, 
with Adjumani facing substantial challenges across multiple metrics. 
While Moyo serves as a model of relatively successful educational outcomes, 
Adjumani requires immediate and comprehensive intervention to address systemic issues 
related to teaching quality, student attendance, and academic support.

The recommendations provided offer a structured approach to addressing these challenges, 
with immediate actions focused on the most struggling schools and longer-term strategies 
aimed at creating sustainable improvement across the entire educational ecosystem of the Madi sub-region.
